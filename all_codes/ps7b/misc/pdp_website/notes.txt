	Today what was handled included breaking down the pros and cons
of the current website interface. Had help from brother to help decide what the new interface should look like and what to include and what not to include. Initial design sketch completed.
	As far as coding for this goes, will most likely just create the html pages and make sure everything is linked together properly. Will most likely spend this session playing around with declaring bootstrap/javascript statements in separate files to make HTML code look cleaner.
		Completed:
			- set up all html pages that are ready to be edited
			- set up seperate css files
			- set up navigation task bar
